## Provably Fair ##

UC Casino Foundation's random number generator (RNG) facilitates SHA256 hash function and uuid4. First of all, for provable fairness, RNG generates the list of hashes. Each element in the list is the hash of the previous hash. The first hash is generated by uuid4. Then the list is reversed so that it provides the consecutively verifiable hash list, i.e. hashing the current hash outputs of the previous game’s hash. This reversed hash list is uncheatable and easily verifiable because no one can predict the next hash in the reversed hash list in the reasonable time and anyone can verify the current hash is valid by hashing the current hash. Each game uses a random number for its own use. For example, Baccarat uses a random number to shuffle the eight-deck shoe.

# Fisher-Yates-Shuffle

The Fisher–Yates shuffle is an algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence—in plain terms, the algorithm shuffles the sequence. The algorithm effectively puts all the elements into a hat; it continually determines the next element by randomly drawing an element from the hat until no elements remain. The algorithm produces an unbiased permutation: every permutation is equally likely. The modern version of the algorithm is efficient: it takes time proportional to the number of items being shuffled and shuffles them in place.

```
export function createShuffledDeck(hash: string, salt: string) {
  const deck = createDeck();
  const random = new Hash(hash, salt);
  // random shuffle deck, using fisher-yates algorithm
  for (const i of [...Array.from({ length: deck.length - 1 })].keys()) {
    const j = Math.floor(random.nextNormal() * (deck.length - i)) + i;
    [deck[i], deck[j]] = [deck[j], deck[i]];
  }
  return deck
}
```
